# GODOT-Rotating-Movement_Component

This is the development of a rotating movement component designed to be attached to a Node3D

The demo folder contains an example of usage of this component

Also this component has been tested in https://jocarpe.itch.io/third-person-character-demo

This is a demo in continuous development to test all the components developed and in the process of future development. 

It also adds the ability to change characters and view resource consumption via a plugin. 

A detailed explanation of how the demo works is available on the itch.io page indicated. 

Feel free to check it out in either of its two versions, Windows or Linux.

The same demo is available for First Person Character in https://jocarpe.itch.io/godots-first-person
